Hi!

The following projects are final submissions for the Algorithms in Bioinformatics class at Johns Hopkins University, as a part of the M.S. Bioinformatics curriculum.
I will be constantly updating the projects with the goal of perfecting its designated functions, as well as for further run-time optimization. 
The code is not perfect yet, but it will be my personal challenge to get there. :)

Please feel free to browse the projects and play around with the example I/O provided. 
A separate README file for each individual project is located in the Project's folder. 
And lastly, thank you for your time!
